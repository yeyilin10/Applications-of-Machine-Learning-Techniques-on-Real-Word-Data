# Machine Learning Techniques on Real World Data

This repository contains the code and report for our group project on the applications of machine learning techniques on real-world data. The project was conducted as part of the ST443 course at the Department of Statistics, The London School of Economics and Political Science.


## Project Overview

The project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to two different datasets: 

1. IBM Employee Attrition Data: The objective of this analysis is to predict the attrition status of an employee and explore the factors that influence their decision to leave the company.

2. Concrete Compressive Strength Data: This analysis aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on various attributes.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `code/` directory: Contains the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation for both datasets.
- `data/` directory: Contains the raw data used in the analysis.
- `report/` directory: Contains the report summarizing our findings, including detailed descriptions of the datasets, data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and performance evaluation.
- `README.md` file: Provides an overview of the project and repository structure.

## Results and Conclusion

Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques on the given datasets. We compare the performance of various models based on evaluation metrics such as area under the ROC curve (AUC) and sensitivity. The logistic regression, SVM, LDA, and Neural Networks models exhibit the highest AUC and sensitivity, while the KNN and decision tree models perform relatively poorly.

Based on our findings, we recommend using logistic regression as the best model for predicting employee attrition in the IBM dataset. However, further research and experimentation may be required to determine the optimal model for predicting concrete compressive strength.
